## What It Does

In today's information-dense world, we constantly encounter new terms, concepts, and complex sentences. The typical workflow involves highlighting text, copying it, opening a new tab, and pasting it into a search engine or AI. This context-switching is inefficient and breaks concentration.

AI Text Explainer solves this problem by bringing the power of generative AI directly to your selection. Simply highlight any text, and a discreet "Explain" button appears. A single click provides a clear, concise explanation in a clean modal overlay, keeping you focused and in your workflow.

## ‚úÖ Key Features

-   **On-Demand Explanations:** Get AI-generated explanations for any text on any webpage without leaving the page.
-   **Contextual UI:** An elegant "Explain" button appears contextually right next to your selected text, providing a seamless user experience.
-   **Secure API Key Storage:** Your Google Gemini API key is stored securely and locally using the `chrome.storage` API.
-   **Clean & Responsive Modal:** Explanations are displayed in a beautifully styled and responsive modal overlay that works on any site.
-   **Powered by Google Gemini:** Leverages the speed and intelligence of the Gemini API for high-quality, relevant explanations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Core logic for DOM manipulation, event handling, and API communication.
